Healthcare Database Analysis â€” CMS Hospital General Information (SQL) ðŸ§­ Project Description

This project analyzes a dataset of U.S. hospitals (CMS Hospital General Information) to extract operational and quality insights: emergency coverage, distribution by state/ownership/type, and patterns in the overall rating (1â€“5). The full pipeline is carried out in PostgreSQL, from CSV ingestion and cleaning to modeling, creation of views, indexes, and analytical queries. Optionally, the results can be visualized in Excel or Power BI and documented in a report.

Data source: Hospital_General_Information_CLEAN.csv (38 fields) â€” a cleaned version prepared in Excel and exported to CSV (UTF-8, with header).
