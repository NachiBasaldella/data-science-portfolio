# 🧠 Predictive Models

This project focuses on building and evaluating **predictive models** applied to real-world datasets in domains such as **health, finance, and education**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Apply data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Build predictive models to estimate outcomes based on structured data  
- Compare different algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)  
- Evaluate models with appropriate metrics depending on the problem  
- Communicate results with clear visualizations and insights  

---

## 📊 Example Use Cases
- Health: predicting patient readmission risk or disease likelihood  
- Finance: predicting loan default or credit scoring  
- Education: predicting student performance or dropout risk  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas / NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- XGBoost / LightGBM  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
