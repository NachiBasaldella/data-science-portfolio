# 🤖 Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains my end-to-end Machine Learning work focused on building, analyzing, and evaluating predictive models using Python.  
Each project is structured following best practices in data science: EDA, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, reporting, and reproducibility.

Currently, the portfolio includes:

---

## 🩺 **Diabetes Prediction (Classification)**  
**Goal:** Predict the likelihood of diabetes using clinical and demographic patient information.

### 🔍 What the project includes
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
- Model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC)  
- Feature importance analysis  
- Automated report generation (metrics + visualizations)

### 📊 Key Insights
- ~35% of patients in the dataset are diagnosed with diabetes.  
- Glucose, BMI, and Age are the strongest predictors.  
- Best model reached **72% accuracy** and **64% recall** for diabetic patients.  
- Results are medically meaningful and aligned with real-world risk factors.
