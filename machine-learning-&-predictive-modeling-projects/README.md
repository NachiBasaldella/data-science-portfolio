## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Train and evaluate classification and regression models  
- Apply cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and pipelines  
- Interpret model performance using metrics and visualizations  
- Communicate findings and actionable insights

## 📁 Folder Structure
Each project follows the same organization:

project-name/
├─ notebooks/ # Jupyter notebooks (EDA, modeling, evaluation)
├─ src/ # Python scripts and reusable functions
├─ data/ # Raw and processed datasets (ignored in git)
├─ models/ # Trained model artifacts (ignored in git)
└─ reports/ # Visualizations, metrics, and results

---
> Many of these notebooks use open-source datasets from Kaggle, UCI, or public APIs. All results are reproducible and documented.
