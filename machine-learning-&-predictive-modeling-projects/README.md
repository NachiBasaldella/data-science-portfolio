## Machine Learning Projects

A collection of end-to-end Machine Learning projects covering supervised and unsupervised techniques.
Each project includes:

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-Feature engineering

-Modeling & evaluation

-Interpretability

-Clear reports & visual insights

*Projects*
Project	Description	Tech
