# 🌐 API Integration & Web Scraping Projects

This folder contains projects focused on **extracting data** from web pages and APIs using Python. The goal is to collect, clean, and structure external data sources for analysis or automation.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- `requests`
- `BeautifulSoup` (bs4)
- `Selenium`
- JSON, CSV, XML processing

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Automate data extraction from websites (static & dynamic content)
- Integrate with public APIs to collect real-time or historical data
- Parse and clean data into usable formats (CSV, JSON, DataFrame)
- Handle pagination, headers, authentication and rate-limiting
- Prepare data for downstream analysis and visualization

## 📁 Project Examples
- 📰 Scraping news headlines from media sites
- 📈 Collecting stock prices or crypto data via APIs
- 📊 Extracting tables from HTML pages (e.g., Wikipedia, sports stats)
- 🗺️ Gathering geo-data or weather info from public endpoints

These projects strengthen core skills in **data engineering**, **automation**, and **real-world data acquisition**.
