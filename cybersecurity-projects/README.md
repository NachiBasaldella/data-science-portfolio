# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Projects

This folder contains projects focused on key areas of **cybersecurity**, including vulnerability assessment, secure coding, network traffic analysis, and ethical hacking techniques.

These hands-on projects are designed to simulate real-world security challenges and build practical skills in detecting, analyzing, and mitigating threats.

## üõ† Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (for scripting and automation)
- Wireshark / tcpdump (network analysis)
- Nmap, Metasploit, Nessus (scanning and exploitation)
- Burp Suite (web security testing)
- Hashcat / John the Ripper (password cracking)
- OWASP Top 10 practices

## üéØ Project Objectives
- Identify and exploit common vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, CSRF, etc.)
- Analyze and interpret network traffic for suspicious activity
- Automate password brute-forcing and hash cracking
- Harden systems and code to prevent common exploits
- Simulate penetration testing workflows

## üìÅ Project Examples
- üîç Vulnerability scanning and reporting with Nmap & Nessus
- üß™ Exploiting and patching OWASP Top 10 web vulnerabilities
- üì° Network packet analysis using Wireshark
- üîê Brute-force password cracking simulations
- üíª Secure login systems and input validation testing

These projects are intended for **educational and ethical purposes only**, with a focus on improving defensive and offensive cybersecurity understanding.
