# NYC Taxi Trip Data — Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs exploratory data analysis and data cleaning on the NYC Taxi Trip dataset. The goal is to discover insights into ride patterns, fare structures, and temporal trends, and to prepare clean data for modeling.

## 🚀 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Identify and handle missing values and outliers in trip data
- Analyze trip durations, distances, and fares
- Explore temporal and spatial ride patterns
- Detect data inconsistencies and anomalies
- Generate visualizations for storytelling
- Prepare clean datasets for further analysis or modeling

## 📁 Project Structure

- **data/** → Raw and processed datasets
- **notebooks/** → Jupyter notebooks with analysis and code
- **outputs/** → Generated plots, charts, and clean data files
- **scripts/** → Python scripts for reusable code
